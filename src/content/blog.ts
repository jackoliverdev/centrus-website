While current trends like data security, sustainability, and talent shortages take centre stage, an ongoing challenge continues to set businesses back every year. Now AI has the potential to help.

Managing and leveraging internal knowledge is a struggle for all businesses, from not analysing results properly, to slow sharing of information. With a growing volume of data and fragmented information silos, teams struggle to access and utilise insights efficiently. Traditional knowledge management approaches often fall short, resulting in wasted time, duplicated efforts, and missed opportunities for innovation and growth.

Centrus AI presents a game-changing solution to these challenges by revolutionising conventional knowledge management methods. Instead of relying on organised information hubs that quickly become outdated and segmented, or investing and retaining designated knowledge management staff, Centrus AI allows organisations to streamline processes effortlessly.

By seamlessly integrating with all of your existing platforms, systems, and tools, Centrus AI creates a single, unified access point for your company's collective knowledge, without the need to physically relocate or reorganise your data. But with a twist, Centrus is your very own AI colleague, that you can interact with and ask questions for instant responses on what you need in that moment.

## Knocking down the information silos

One of the most persistent challenges in knowledge management is the existence of information silos, where valuable data remains trapped within different departments or systems, hindering efficient information sharing and access.

Centrus AI tackles this issue head-on by integrating data from various sources, providing a centralised access point for information retrieval. This unification means that crucial insights and data are no longer confined to specific teams or platforms but are readily accessible across your entire organisation, within set boundaries. As a result, your employees spend less time searching for information and more time applying it to their tasks, fostering a more collaborative and efficient work environment.

## Enhancing Search Capabilities

Traditional search methods often struggle when dealing with complex queries or vast amounts of data. Centrus AI revolutionises search capabilities by enabling users to ask nuanced questions in plain language and receive accurate, contextual answers.

Leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, Centrus AI understands the intent behind queries and retrieves the most relevant information. This not only improves the speed and accuracy of information retrieval but also democratises access to knowledge, allowing employees at all levels to quickly find the data they need without specialised training.

## Avoiding Duplication

In many organisations, duplicated research and efforts are common due to a lack of visibility into existing data and projects. Centrus AI addresses this by connecting disparate platforms and data sources, providing a comprehensive view of what has already been done.

This prevents teams from reinventing the wheel and ensures that they build on previous work rather than duplicating it. The result is a more efficient use of resources, as efforts are concentrated on new and innovative tasks rather than redundant ones.

## Improving Visibility

Centrus AI enhances visibility into past work and institutional knowledge, which is crucial for continuous improvement and learning. By maintaining a detailed and accessible record of previous projects, decisions, and outcomes, Centrus AI enables teams to learn from past successes and mistakes.

This historical insight allows for better decision-making and strategy development, as teams can easily reference what has worked well in the past and avoid previous pitfalls. Improved visibility also fosters a culture of transparency and accountability within your organisation.

## Streamlining Collaboration

Centrus AI makes knowledge easily accessible and actionable, significantly improving collaboration and decision-making. By providing a single source of truth and breaking down barriers to information access, Centrus AI ensures that all team members are on the same page and can contribute effectively.

This streamlined access to information facilitates cross-functional collaboration, as teams can easily share insights and work together toward common goals. Additionally, Centrus AI can automate routine tasks, freeing up your employees to focus on more strategic and creative aspects of their work.

## Ensuring Accuracy

Maintaining accurate and up-to-date information is a perpetual challenge for organisations. Centrus AI helps by constantly updating and verifying data, ensuring that the information available is current and reliable.

This creates a single source of truth that teams can rely on for making informed decisions. Centrus AI's commitment to accuracy also reduces the risk of errors and misinformation, which can have significant negative impacts on business outcomes. By ensuring that all data is accurate and up-to-date, Centrus AI enhances the overall quality of knowledge management within your organisation.

In 2023, over 4,000 cyberattacks were reported in Europe alone. No organisations big or small were safe and even those in the FTSE 100 faced these threats. So, it's now common knowledge that today's digital landscape requires an intelligent, thorough approach to digital security.

Organisations must consider internal threats, too. Protecting sensitive information and ensuring this data is only accessible on a 'need-to-know' basis is a valid concern for businesses across Europe.

When managing and leveraging business data, trust in software providers' integrity is paramount. That's why we've built our AI platform with your privacy and security at the forefront. From protecting data to receiving accurate responses below are 5 reasons you can rely on Centrus AI.

## 1. Complete data encryption

Centrus AI implements complete data encryption both in transit (when data is moving between different points, like from your computer to our servers or between different parts of our system) and at rest (when data is stored and not actively moving, like when it's saved in our databases or storage systems), ensuring your information is protected at all times. We use AWS servers to store our data for the best security infrastructure, encryptions and certifications.

As a European-based company, we adhere to all GDPR practices and are actively working towards obtaining industry-standard certifications. We are committed to continuously reviewing our security measures to ensure the highest safety for our users.

## 2. Robust role-based access control

Our unique role-based access control system ensures that your employees can only access information they're authorised to access. This granular control over data access reinforces the security and relevance of all data interactions within your organisation. With Centrus, you can trust that sensitive information remains accessible only to designated individuals, significantly reducing the risk of accidental information leaks.

This works by having internally-selected administrators to have the authority to select who can access the information they've uploaded to Centrus. These role-based tags are flexible and can be changed when you need them to.

## 3. Your data stays private and secure

Access to your data is strictly controlled - only your authorised company administrators can manage your personalised version of Centrus. We maintain the highest data privacy standards, never storing, copying, or indexing your data beyond what's necessary for the platform to function. Your business intelligence remains fully confidential and protected at all times.

## 4. Accurate AI responses

Accurate data is essential for effective business decisions. Centrus has been engineered by AI experts to generate responses by intelligently analysing your company's verified data sources.

Our AI models precisely match your queries with relevant information from your data, ensuring reliable and trustworthy insights. Every response includes a clear reference showing the exact source of the information, so you can be confident that Centrus is pulling data from authorised company sources.

## 5. Your intelligent business information hub

Centrus AI understands that every organisation has unique data requirements. We provide personalised responses to your queries by analysing your specific business data and context, delivering insights that are precisely relevant to your needs.

Unlike generic search engines or AI tools, Centrus focuses exclusively on your business environment. Simply ask questions in plain language, and receive clear, targeted answers drawn from your company's data. This smart approach saves time, eliminates information overload, and ensures you get actionable insights that matter to your business.

ChatGPT receives over 10 million queries each day, and impressively hit 100 million weekly users in November 2023. So, how does Centrus AI compare to ChatGPT?

## 1. The information source

Centrus AI sources all of its knowledge from your company's information. It integrates with your digital tools and platforms, and the company documents you upload to it. This means every interaction is based on your specific business context, ensuring relevance and accuracy. Moreover, Centrus prioritises data security, implementing robust encryption and access controls to keep your sensitive information protected at all times.

ChatGPT is different because it sources its information from data it finds across the internet, making it a generalised tool that might not answer to the benefit of your specific needs. This means ChatGPT is difficult to completely trust and integrate for daily business use. This is why many organisations have banned the use of ChatGPT to prevent incorrect information being released in external communications.

## 2. Integrations

One of Centrus AI's most powerful differences is its ability to integrate with an ever-growing range of digital software. From Google Drive to Microsoft Teams, Centrus allows you to query data across multiple locations that hold your organisation's information without switching between applications. This seamless integration dramatically improves efficiency and provides a holistic view of your business information.

ChatGPT can only be integrated with the back-end locations that its developers choose, giving no control to the user on where they want to pull data from.

## 3. Transparency and Source Attribution

Centrus AI prioritises transparency; every response includes references to the specific documents or data sources it used to provide your answer, allowing you to verify information with ease and confidence. Your Centrus admins have access to chat histories, allowing for full transparency and audit trails. Therefore, this feature not only builds trust but also helps in maintaining accountability and ensuring compliance within your organisation.

ChatGPT, often provides information without clear sources, and you may have to ask it where it sourced the information from before visiting that website and double checking its validity for yourself. For many queries ChatGPT admits itself that there wasn't any one source it retrieved data from, explaining it uses general knowledge. This can be disadvantageous when used in a business setting where you need to back up the information's location to ensure its integrity.

## 4. Customised AI Solutions

Centrus AI goes beyond general-purpose artificial intelligence. We offer additional custom AI development to address your specific business needs. Whether it's for streamlining particular operations, automating complex processes, or developing unique AI-driven tools, Centrus can work with you to create tailored solutions that drive efficiency and innovation in your business. This includes developing tailored AI for your most time-consuming tasks.

ChatGPT has regular updates but it will only ever be an all-purpose AI search engine that ultimately competes with Google Search. OpenAI focuses on making ChatGPT more human in its upgrades which is not so much our focus at Centrus AI. We want to curate your very own personalised AI assistant to help you where you need it most.

## 5. Strict Data Privacy and Compliance

Centrus AI has grown from bottom up with business privacy and compliance in mind. With your very own version of the software, designed specifically for your business day-to-day use, everything that goes into your Centrus account stays within your organisation, and is protected.

OpenAI openly states that ChatGPT is not secure for businesses. If someone in your organisation mistakenly shares sensitive information in ChatGPT, it could lead to potential privacy concerns and data breaches. Therefore many businesses like Apple and Amazon have banned employees from using the software.

## Choosing Centrus AI for Your Business

While ChatGPT is an impressive tool for general use, Centrus AI is purpose-built for business. By offering secure, integrated, and customised AI solutions, Centrus empowers your team to work smarter, not harder. Our platform combines the power of AI with your unique business knowledge, resulting in more accurate, relevant, and actionable insights.

With Centrus, you're not just adopting an AI tool; you're gaining a partner committed to enhancing your business operations through intelligent, secure, and integrated AI solutions.

Artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT have revolutionised how we solve problems, create content, and manage tasks across various industries. 
It's important to remember that the quality of responses you receive directly depends on how well you present your questions or tasks. Therefore, to harness the full potential of ChatGPT, crafting effective prompts is key. This guide will walk you through the best practices for writing prompts to get the best results from ChatGPT and other AI search engines.

## 1. Define the purpose and scope
Before you start writing your prompt, think about the purpose (why you need it) and scope (how much you need). Knowing exactly what you want to achieve will help you frame your request more effectively. Unlike traditional search engines, AI does better with more information. So don't hold back on all the details of what you need.

Example:
Instead of:
"What marketing do small businesses need to do?"

Try:
"Pitch me 4 different marketing strategies, that include social media, email marketing, and ads, that have been proven to work for small businesses."

This prompt directs the AI to provide something specific for you, so you are more likely to appreciate the answer and find it useful. Your preferred artificial intelligence search engine understands the context you provide, no matter how long your prompt is, and delivers the focused response.

## 2. Be Clear and Specific
Ambiguity is a common pitfall in prompt writing. Don't let yourself make this mistake. If you are not clear or specific in what you want from your AI, then the AI will create its own ideas of what you might like. In some cases, it might be interesting to see what the AI decides for you, but for the most part, the AI needs clear and specific prompts to provide you the best answer. 

The more details you provide, the better ChatGPT, or any AI search engine, can tailor its response to meet your needs.

Example:
Instead of:
"Write me a short story."

Try:
"Write a 500-700 word science fiction story set in a future where humans have colonised Mars. Focus on the daily life of a settler and the challenges they face, with some comedy throughout."

By specifying the length, genre, setting, and focus, you are offering clear and specific guidance for your AI search engine. This will help it produce a response that is more to your needs. 

## 3. Break Down Complex Tasks
For complex tasks, even following the first two steps above will not be enough. Complex tasks can be overwhelming for artificial intelligence. Therefore, breaking tasks down into smaller, manageable steps can improve the quality of the response. You can also encourage the AI to think in a certain professional mindset.

Example:
Instead of:
"Write a 1,000 word essay on the causes and effects of climate change since 1950, with a focus on the impact on animal and plant species."

Try:
"I am writing a 1,000 word essay on climate change in the UK since 1950. My questions below will all be related to this. Please think and respond in the same way as an environmental scientist. 
Summarise the primary and secondary causes of UK climate change in ~300 words.
Describe the effects of climate change on British weather patterns and what weather would be like if the climate had not changed. Max 400 words.
Explain the impact of climate change on animals and plants living in the UK, in ~200 words.
Conclude the research you've provided and what it means for living in the UK in the future"

This step-by-step approach allows ChatGPT and any other AI search engine to address each part of the complex task thoroughly. Giving you the best, specific answers throughout your response.

## 4. Provide Context and Examples
Context helps ChatGPT, or your preferred AI search engine, to understand the framework within which it needs to operate. Asking your AI to act in a specified role, and asking it to provide examples can further clarify your expectations.

Example:
Instead of:
"What kind of man was King Henry VIII to kill so many of his wives?"

Try:
"As a historian for the Tudors, break down King Henry VIII's personality traits to showcase why he killed his wives. Please provide an example of his actions to explain each trait you've listed."

This prompt provides context (personality traits of a Tudor king to order death of his wives) and requests for an example to prove the personality traits the AI suggested were correct.

## 5. Set Constraints and Guidelines
Defining constraints and guidelines helps AI search engines understand the boundaries within which it should operate, ensuring the responses align with your requirements.

Example:
Instead of:
"Write a book review of 'Murder on the Orient Express' by Agatha Christie."

Try:
"Write me a 100-word review of the book 'Murder on the Orient Express' by Agatha Christie. Focus on the plot, character development, and writing style. Avoid spoilers and maintain a neutral tone."

This prompt sets clear constraints on length, focus areas, and tone, helping AI produce a more suitable review. The guidelines here are that the AI must not reveal any spoilers and keep a neutral tone so it is unbiased.

## 6. Iterate and Refine
Iterative prompting is the continuing refinement and adjustment of your prompt, improving the accuracy and relevance of AI responses. So, don't hesitate to refine your prompts based on the responses you receive. 

Example:
Initial prompt:
"Explain how the internet exists."

Refined prompt:
"Explain how the internet was made, how it runs now, and if anything has developed or improved over time."

Iteration after first response:
"Explain what the internet is, and how it can spread so widely across the world. I'd like an in-depth explanation with a simple diagram with each point you explain."

By refining your prompt, you can guide ChatGPT or any other AI search tool to provide more detailed and relevant information.

## Conclusion
Crafting effective prompts is a skill that can significantly enhance your interactions with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini or any other AI search engine. By defining the purpose, being specific, breaking down complex tasks, providing context, setting constraints, and iterating on your initial requests, you can achieve better results. Implement these techniques to make the most out of your AI search capabilities and improve the quality of its responses.`
